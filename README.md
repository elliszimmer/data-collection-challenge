# data-collection-challenge

The module 12 challenged is focused around web-scraping and data analysis, throughout which we will be identifying HTML elements on a page, their ID and class attributes. We will use this knowledge to extract information via automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing using Beautiful Soup. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. The challenge will consist of collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating the insights. This assignment requires the following deliverables:

##### Deliverable 1: 
Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

##### Deliverable 2: 
Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
